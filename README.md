# MyTechBlog

## Description

The aim of this project is the creation of a blog where user can create an account, that will allow them to interact with posts created by other users and comment, see the comment history, the post history among others. In addition, they will be allowed to create posts themselves, where other users can interact and add their thoughts. In addition, they can delete and edit their posts as long as they are logged in in their accounts. This project is based on the MVC (Model, View, Controller) concept and focuses on the use of handlebars, which was new knowledge for me.
## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
